# AthletesForKidsProject
Database app that lets mentors log in and record time and activities with buddy. Admin can log in to manage all data input. 
I coded this app in January/February of 2018 as my Internal Assessment in IB Computer Science SL. 
It uses SQL Database as well as JavaSwing interface. 
All original code can be found under src/AppDraft


About Athletes for Kids:
A non-profit organization where high school athletes are paired with a younger child with special needs. The mentors are responsible for spending time with their buddy in creative ways on a weekly basis. Currently mentors log hours and activities once at the end of each month, however I thought this system could be improved to an app where mentors can input hours and activities whenever they do them, and the admin still has access to view and manage the data for all mentors.
