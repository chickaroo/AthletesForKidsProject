Database app that lets mentors log in and record time and activities with buddy. Admin can log in to manage all data input. 
I coded this app in January/February of 2018 as my Internal Assesment in IB Computer Science SL. 
It uses SQL Database as well as JavaSwing interface. 
All original code can be found under srs/
